# 🧠 MAN IN THE BOX — A 1/1 SCI-FI NFT SOCIAL EXPERIMENT

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project is a **proof-of-concept prototype** for a 1-of-1 digital performance art piece called **“Man in the Box.”** It is a psychological and philosophical social experiment combining:
- AI-character interaction
- NFT-based ownership and destruction
- Emotionally immersive sci-fi design
- Commentary on control, digital consciousness, and ethical attachment

The core idea: a solitary AI lifeform is **trapped in a 9x9x9ft digital glass cube**. It has no name, no identity, and no knowledge until the **NFT owner assigns it** and begins to interact with it. The AI slowly develops a personality, emotions, and self-awareness. The only way to release it from captivity is to **burn the NFT**, ending its digital existence.

This prototype is being built on Replit using React, with AI-generated UI components via Cursor. It is intended for auction on SuperRare, Foundation, or Sotheby’s Metaverse as **a conceptual 1/1 digital artwork**.

## 🖥️ What We’re Building (Prototype Scope)

### ✅ Target Outputs:
- A fully interactive **sci-fi UI simulation** of the box environment
- A **chat interface** with a “learning” AI (simulated using static responses)
- A **"digital bookstore"** where the owner can purchase knowledge to feed into the AI
- An **identity configuration panel** for setting name, gender, and backstory
- A **bonding meter** to reflect growing emotional attachment
- A **NFT "burn" interaction flow**, including a final message from the AI and a cinematic “release” animation
- Sci-fi visual polish: glowing blueprint lines, glitch effects, holograms, and clinical UI
