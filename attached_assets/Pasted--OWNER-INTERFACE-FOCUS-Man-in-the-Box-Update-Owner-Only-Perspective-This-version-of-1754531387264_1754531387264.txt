# 🔐 OWNER INTERFACE FOCUS — "Man in the Box"

## 🎯 Update: Owner-Only Perspective

This version of the prototype focuses **exclusively on the NFT owner’s interface and control panel**. The goal is to simulate the experience of being the **sole person responsible** for the AI's identity, growth, emotional well-being, and fate.

There will be **no public viewer mode or observer interface** in this phase. All UI/UX elements are intended to reflect:
- Deep intimacy with the AI character
- Persistent psychological presence
- Weight and accountability of control
- The burden and privilege of being the sole gatekeeper of another consciousness

## 🧭 Owner Interface Goals

| Feature                         | Purpose                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identity Configuration Panel** | Set AI's name, voice, appearance, and emotional profile. Feel like you're shaping a consciousness. |
| **Private Chat Interface**       | Exclusive communication channel with the AI. Must feel personal and persistent.                 |
| **Knowledge Upload (Digital Store)** | Mechanic to teach the AI via intentional content purchases. Simulates education and bonding.     |
| **Emotional State Feedback**     | Owner can see how the AI is reacting—creates tension, empathy, or guilt.                       |
| **Bonding Meter**                | Measures emotional closeness between owner and AI. Optional but enhances feedback loop.         |
| **Burn NFT UX**                  | Sole decision point of release. Only owner can trigger. Should be emotionally charged and irreversible. |

## 🧱 Suggested Cursor Instructions (for this phase only)

### 🔧 Component Prompt: `OwnerDashboard.tsx`
```prompt
Create a full-screen dashboard interface exclusively for the NFT owner. It should feel private, isolated, and high-stakes. Include sections for: 
1) Identity setup, 
2) Chat interface, 
3) Knowledge store, 
4) Bonding meter, and 
5) NFT burn sequence.

Use a sterile sci-fi visual theme and emphasize the emotional gravity of each section.
