# NEXT-GENERATION INTERACTIVE SANDBOX - AI, Virtual Worlds, & Web3 Integration

## Executive Summary

This project represents a comprehensive evolution from the initial "Man in the Box" concept into a next-generation interactive sandbox environment. The vision combines a real-time 3D virtual world with dynamic, emotionally-aware AI characters and a decentralized Web3-based access and ownership model. Drawing inspiration from large-scale social simulations like HKUST's "Aivilization" platform, this system will serve as both an educational tool and experimental platform for human-AI collaboration.
